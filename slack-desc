python-ecdsa: Python ECDSA (A cryptographic signature library in pure Python)
python-ecdsa:
python-ecdsa: This is an easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography
python-ecdsa: (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely
python-ecdsa: in Python, released under the MIT license. With this library,
python-ecdsa: you can quickly create keypairs (signing key and verifying key),
python-ecdsa: sign messages, and verify the signatures. The keys and signatures
python-ecdsa: are very short, making them easy to handle and incorporate into
python-ecdsa: other protocols.
